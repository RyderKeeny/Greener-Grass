# Greener-Grass

## Description
with the purpose of helping the agricultural field or those self-starting their own home farm, Greener Grass will help.

This project is designed to analyze environmental risks to livestock by processing user-provided reference photos. The system scans each image and applies machine learning algorithms, paired with a dataset API, to generate a statistical analysis of potential hazards.

By assessing the likelihood of specific dangers, the tool provides actionable insights that can help users make informed decisions about animal safety. Additionally, users can filter results based on the type of livestock or pets they want to monitor, allowing the AI to deliver more targeted and optimized predictions.

### Framework / Libraries incorporated

Built in Rust using the **Dioxus** Framework allowing for a full stack development 
using maching Learning elements such as **linfa** and **dfdx** and using binds for connecting to popular python libraries such as **tch-rs** (Torch)
